        ACM SAC 2017

For the past thirty years, the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing 
has been a primary gathering forum for applied computer scientists, 
computer engineers, software engineers, and application developers 
from around the world. SAC 2017 is sponsored by the ACM Special 
Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP), and will be held in 
Marrakech (Morocco).


        SOAP TRACK: CALL FOR PAPERS

Service-Oriented Programming (SOP) is quickly changing our vision 
of software development, bringing a paradigmatic shift in the 
methodologies followed by programmers when designing and implementing 
distributed systems. SOP originally triggered a radical transformation 
of the Web, from being a means of presenting information to a wide 
spectrum of people to becoming a computational fabric. In such fabric, 
loosely-coupled services publish their interfaces and, through them, 
discover and interact with each other abstracting from their internal 
implementations. While this transformation still continues today, it 
has also already generated other shifts in how programmers deal with 
resource handling (Cloud Computing) and the scalability of software 
architectures from the very small to the very large (Microservices). 
Research on SOP is giving strong impetus to the development of new 
technologies and tools for creating and deploying distributed software. 
In the context of this modern paradigm we have to cope with an old 
challenge, like in the early days of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
when consistency in the programming model definition was not achieved 
until the introduction of key features like encapsulation, inheritance, 
and polymorphism, together with proper design methodologies. The complex 
scenario of SOP needs to be clarified on many aspects, both from the 
engineering and from the foundational points of view.

From the engineering point of view, there are open issues at many levels. 
Among others, at the system design level, both traditional approaches 
based on UML and approaches taking inspiration from business process 
modelling, e.g. BPMN, are used. At the composition level, orchestration 
and choreography are continuously improved both formally and practically, 
with an evident need for their integration in the development process. 
At the description and discovery level there are two separate communities 
pushing respectively the semantic approach (ontologies, OWL, ...) and the 
syntactic one like WSDL. In particular, the role of discovery engines and 
protocols is not clear. In this respect we still lack adopted standards: 
UDDI looked to be a good candidate, but it is no longer pushed by the main 
corporations, and its wide adoption seems difficult. Furthermore, a recent
implementation platform, the so-called REST services, is emerging and 
competing with classic Web Services. Finally, features like Quality of 
Service, security and dependability need to be taken seriously into account, 
and this investigation should lead to standard proposals.

From the foundational point of view, researchers have discussed widely in 
the last years, and many attempts to use formal methods for specification 
and verification in this setting have been made. Session correlation, service 
types, contract theories and communication patterns are only a few examples 
of the aspects that have been investigated. Moreover, several formal models 
based upon automata, Petri nets and algebraic approaches have been developed. 
However, most of these approaches concentrate only on a few features of 
Service-Oriented Systems in isolation, and a comprehensive approach is still 
far from being achieved.

Our track aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners having the 
common objective of transforming SOP into a mature discipline with both solid 
scientific foundations and mature software engineering development methodologies 
supported by dedicated tools. In particular, we will encourage works and 
discussions about what SOP still needs in order to achieve its original goal.

        SUBMISSIONS

Authors are invited to submit original unpublished papers. Submission
of the same paper to multiple tracks is not allowed. Peer groups with
expertise in the track focus area will double-blindly review submissions. 
Accepted papers will be published in the annual conference proceedings. 
SOAP track chairs will not submit to the track. Submissions from SOAP PC 
members and from PC members and track chairs of other SAC tracks are 
welcome. Submission guidelines can be found on the SAC 2017 website:
    
	http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2017/

Prospective papers should be submitted to the track using the provided
automated submission system. Please pay attention to ensure anonymity
of your submitted manuscript as detailed in the submission page so to
allow for double-blind review. Papers not satisfying this constraint
will be automatically rejected. The maximum length for papers is 8
pages. Accepted papers whose camera-ready version will exceed 6 pages
will have to pay an extra charge. 

Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the papers, 
posters, or SRC abstracts in the conference proceedings. An author or 
a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This is a requirement for 
the presented work to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital library.
No-show of registered papers, posters, and SRC abstracts will result 
in excluding them from the ACM/IEEE digital library.


        SPECIAL ISSUE

We plan a special issue of a top-level journal for which we will invite 
the best papers. 


        STUDENT RESEARCH COMPETITION PROGRAM 

As before, SAC 2017 organizes a Student Research Competition (SRC)
Program to provide graduate students the opportunity to meet and
exchange ideas with researchers and practitioners in their areas of
interest. For guidelines and information about the SRC program:

http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2017/src17.htm. 

Submission of research abstracts (maximum of 2 pages) to the SRC 
program should be in electronic form via the SAC 2017 website:

http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2017/

Submission of the same abstract to multiple tracks is not allowed. 
All research abstract submissions will be reviewed by researchers 
and practitioners with expertise in the track focus area to which 
they are submitted. Authors of selected abstracts will have the 
opportunity to give poster presentations of their work and compete
for three top-winning places. The Student Research Competition
committee will evaluate and select First-, Second-, and Third- place
winners. The winners will receive cash awards and SIGAPP recognition
certificates during the conference banquet. Authors of selected
abstracts are eligible to apply to the SIGAPP Student Travel Award
program for support.
